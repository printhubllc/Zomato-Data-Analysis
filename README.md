# Zomato Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the **Zomato Data Analysis** project! This project demonstrates how to analyze Zomato restaurant data using **Power BI** and **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the dataset by leveraging advanced DAX techniques and dynamic visualization features in Power BI.

## Overview
In this project, I worked on analyzing the Zomato restaurant dataset to uncover trends and insights. I created interactive visualizations to help users understand various aspects of the data, such as restaurant ratings, top restaurants, and dynamic data slicing.

## Key Learnings
During this project, I focused on learning the following key concepts:

1. **Dynamic Titles Using DAX**  
   I implemented dynamic titles in Power BI that adjust based on user interactions with slicers and filters. This feature enhances the user experience by providing contextually relevant information.

2. **Top N Slicer Using DAX**  
   One of the major insights I developed was a custom "Top N" slicer using DAX, allowing users to dynamically filter and analyze the top-performing restaurants based on key metrics such as ratings and reviews.

3. **Creating Tables Using DAX**  
   I learned how to create and manipulate tables using DAX expressions. This allowed me to build customized tables within Power BI that respond to user input and provide detailed data insights.

## Project Features
- **Dynamic Titles**: Titles that change dynamically based on user selections.
- **Top N Slicer**: Allows users to filter the top restaurants based on ratings, reviews, and other key metrics.
- **Custom Tables**: DAX-driven tables that offer granular insights based on various slicers.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Fully interactive dashboards with responsive data exploration options.

## Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: The main tool used for building reports and visualizations.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Used extensively to create dynamic measures, tables, and slicers.
